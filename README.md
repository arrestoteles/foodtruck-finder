## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.ita.chalmers.se:courses/dit341/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd client && npm install
npm run serve
```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

The purpose of the application is to connect food truckers and food lovers. Today, there’s no solution where a consumer can go online and find their favorite food truck in Göteborg. That’s where we come into play. The consumer should be able to search for available food trucks in the city and see what dishes they have. From the other perspective, we want to enable food truck owners to be able to create their own foodtruck profile in the application, so that they can be easily visible to the consumers via the application. 

### Pages

Home Page: The food truck page will display information about the food truck. The information will consist of menus consisting of dishes and prices.

Sign-up Page: The new users can would be able to sign-up to the application through this page.

Login Page: The customers who have already signed up can login to the application by entering their e-mail and password.

Owner Page: The owners will be able to edit the information about their food truck.

Admin Page: The admin will be able to create and delete customers through this page.
